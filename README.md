<h1>Set up</h1>
First, install all the packages from the requirements.txt. <br>
Second, run create_db.py and feed_data.py. It is necessary to create a database and feed data to MySQL. <br>
Last, run app.py to start the web app. 


<h2>Extra</h2>
If you want to see the dashboard, it is dashboard.xlsx. <br>
If you want to see Jupyter Notebook, it is Notebook.ipynb. <br>
If you want to see the SQL script, it is create_db_sql.sql, but I don't recommend using that script to create the database. <br>
For powerpoint, it is call TractorTek.pptx
